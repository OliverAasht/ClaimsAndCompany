Claims and Company API 

Technologies used:
- C#
- .NET 8

This is an API for a fictitious insurance company, where an API needed to be created using .NET Core, to allow their new front end system to communicate with existing SQL Server database.

For now, there is no SQL Server setup and data is currently generated in code. 

Minimal APIs have been used, as well as Object Orientated Programming, Unit Tests, Integration Tests, AutoMapper and Clean Architecture to separate concerns.
